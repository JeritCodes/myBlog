The Mullaperiyar dam has been the bone of contention between Tamil Nadu and Kerala for a long time. Read here to know about the history of the 126 years old dam.

The Supreme Court’s direction recently to the supervisory committee for the Mullaperiyar dam on the issue of the maximum water level has revived the controversy surrounding the dam.

The order was issued while hearing a petition raising apprehensions about the supervision of water levels of the reservoir, especially during the rainy season and as Kerala has also been experiencing unusually heavy spells of rain.

During October 18-25 2021, the dam too received a substantial inflow. Despite the Court’s nod in 2014 to store water up to 142 ft, Tamil Nadu has been careful in drawing as much water as possible so that the level does not reach the permissible level ordinarily.
